= Testing Spring Boot Applications
Phillip Webb

== Initial Import
Introduce the application, show its current form and run the integration test

=== Application overview
* Explain that this is a Boot 1.3 application
* Show main `Application` class
* Show the `domain` package
** Point out `VehicleIdentificationNumber` and the related `VehicleIdentificationNumberAttributeConverter`
* Show the `service` package
** Start with `VehicleDetailsService` then look at `RemoteVehicleDetailsService`
* Show the `web` package
** Start with `UserVehicleController`
** Explain the `UserVehicleService` facade

=== The existing tests
* Show the single `ApplicationIntegrationTest`
* Start MySQL and Show the database
* Start `mvn -Pwiremock`
* Run `curl -v http://localhost:8081/vs/vehicle/01234567890123456/details` (**three times**)
* Run the test in the IDE

== Upgrade
=== Upgrade to Spring Boot 1.4
* Show the POM.xml change
* Show that `@GetMapping` is now used instead of `@RequestMapping`

=== Switch SpringJUnit4ClassRunner to SpringRunner
* Point out the more readable name for SpringJUnit4ClassRunner

=== Migrate to @SpringBootTest
* Show how `@SpringBootTest` replaces `@WebIntegrationTest` and `@SpringApplicationConfiguration`
* Initially use the `classes` attribute to load `Application.class`

=== Don't use @SpringBootTest classes attribute
* Show how the `classes` attribute can often be inferred

=== Use @LocalServerPort in favor of @Value
* Show how `@LocalServerPort` provides a nice shortcut

=== Use @Autowire `TestRestTemplate` for local port
* Show how an autowired `TestRestTemplate` removes the need for `@LocalServerPort`

=== Migrate to AssertJ
* Show the new `assertThat` call
* Explain the benefits of AssertJ
* Explain that it's imported by `spring-boot-starter-test`

=== Remove @Autowired on constructors
* Show how `@Autowired` is no longer needed
* Explain the benefits of constructor injection with respect to testing

== Add UserVehicleService test
* Show how `UserVehicleServiceTest` is a standard JUnit test
* Explain why these are generally the best type of tests to write
* Briefly cover
** How the `ExpectedException` `@Rule` works
** How `@Mock` and BDD Mockito works
** Why tests are commented like they are

== Add domain layer tests
* Show how `VehicleIdentificationNumberTest` is another simple JUnit test
* Show `UserEntityTest`
** Explain slices
** Explain about `@AutoConfigure...` meta-annotations
** Explain use of in-memory database and `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase`
** Explain `TestEntityManager`
* Show `UserRepositoryTest`
** Show that basic queries are working as expected
* Shutdown MySQL
* Show how `ApplicationIntegrationTest` now fails

== Use @AutoConfigureTestDatabase on integration test
* Show how `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` can be mixed into existing tests
* Talk about pros and cons of this approach

== Add service layer tests
* Show the `RemoteVehicleDetailsServiceTest`
** Explain how `MockRestServiceServer` is used
** Show the `protected` method trick to attach the mock
** Show how SpringRunner is not needed
* Show `VehicleDetailsJsonTest`
** Explain `@JsonTest`
** Explain `JacksonTester` (and how it can also be used directly)
** Show the `json` asserts

== Add Mocks
* Shutdown wiremock
* Explain how `ApplicationIntegrationTest` would fails
* Show @MockBean annotation

== Add Spring MVC @Controller tests
* Show `UserVehicleControllerTest`
** Explain how `MockMvc` can be autowired
** Show `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` meta-annotation
** Show use of `@MockBean` again and explain benefit for exceptions
* Show `UserVehicleControllerApplicationTest`
** Explain that this one also needs the database because it loads the full config

== Add Selenium/HTMLUnit controller tests
* Show `UserVehicleControllerSeleniumTest`
* Show `UserVehicleControllerHtmlUnitTest`
